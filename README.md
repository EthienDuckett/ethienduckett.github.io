# [ethienduckett.github.io](https://ethienduckett.github.io)
## History
After I cut off ties with my father I also lost any sense of familiarity to the website https://ejware.com. I have since stopped blogging there entirely and deleted everything I posted. **There is nothing for you to see on ejware.com**. I originally created ethienduckett.github.io as an ego boost a year or so ago; but recently I decided to recreate ethienduckett.github.io as a semi-permanent replacement for the rogue ejware.com. I don't have a use for backend processing so I probably won't ever take this website off of github.
## Blog
Some folders in this repository act like entire projects of their own. I am considering currently whether I should turn them into submodules right now, but for the time being and for ease of development I am just going to leave them statically embedded into this repository.
The blog is a work in progress, but in the near future you can find my writings there.
## Learn Web
I created this project to learn web development and as as a portfolio (because I have nothing else which can **visually** represent my progress in computer science).
