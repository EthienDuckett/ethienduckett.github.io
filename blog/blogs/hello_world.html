	<h1>Welcome to the very first blog.</h1>
	<p>This blog is mostly for testing the blogging system I created and getting it live.</p>
	<p>I hope you are enjoying the theme; it was the easiest yet somehow most satisfying work I have ever done on a computer.</p>
	<p>Well, I suppose I can put a TODO:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Write about what inspired me to start this blog</li>
		<li>Write about what it was like to start this blog</li>
		<li>Write the blog that I was planning on writing for the past few days.</li>
		<li>Add an about me blog?</li>
		<li>dev notes:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Find out a way to preserve the blog_index meta tag, perhaps as a cookie and also perhaps by letting a person copy and paste it into a text box.</li>
			<li>Improve the new_blog.sh command so that I can create the hook in the nvim text editor</li>
			<li>Improve the theme</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
