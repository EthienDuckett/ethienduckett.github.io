		<div class="readable"><p>It all started about 3 days ago. I was watching a physics video when I saw an equation that looked a little bit off. I began searching online to see if the equation was correct and it turns out it was. I was very tired that day so I thought that they were wrong and I then thought that I should write a blog about it. In other words, <b>it is trivial</b>.</p>

Also, I learned more developing this blogging system in 2 days than I did the multiple of nights I spent on <a href="https://github.com/ethienduckett/learn_web" target="_blank">learn_web</a>. I think at the very least I can start a portfolio now.</p>
